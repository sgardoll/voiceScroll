# 🎙️ Voice Scroll

**A bootstrapped teleprompter system for solo creators who can't walk and talk at the same time.**

Most auto-cue apps are expensive and terrible at understanding accents (especially Australian ones). Voice Scroll is a lightweight, open-source solution that uses speech recognition to scroll your script automatically as you speak, matching your natural pacing.

## 🚀 Features
*   **Voice-Activated Scrolling:** The script moves only when you speak.
*   **Accent Agnostic:** Leveraging modern speech-to-text libraries to handle variety in pronunciation.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Built with Flutter to run on Web, macOS, and Windows.
*   **Clean UI:** Dark mode by default (because we're developers).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Framework:** Flutter (Dart)
*   **Origin:** Prototyped in Dreamflow, refined in VS Code.
